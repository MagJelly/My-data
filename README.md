# Welcome!
## This a bug maker(LOL)
A little shy boy likes coding and creating wonderful things.
There are so many creativee idears, but some of them may be too hard to make.
If you find a good projects, it is welcomed to remake it and make it better.
***Open Source is THE BEST!!!!***
## welcome to my project.
In this, you will find a different world with lots of new idears.
Most of them are creative but not useful.
But I believe that ***Immagination is better than magic!!***
## Every Cute Thing is my LOVE
